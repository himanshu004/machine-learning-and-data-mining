Hence it’s robust, flexible.\n","\n","**\tHardware**\n","Google Colab provides support for GraphicProcessing Unit (GPU) apart from it’s existing CPU instances. So, it’s a big deal for all deep learning people.\n","\n","** Pricing**\n","Despite of being so good at hardware, the services provided by Google Colab are completely free. This makes it even more awesome.\n","\n","**Integration with Google Drive**\n","Yes, this seems interesting as you can use your google drive as an interactive file system with Google Colab. This makes it easy to deal with larger files while computing your stuff.\n","\n","**Boon for research and startup community**\n","Perhaps this is the only tool available in the market which provides such a good PaaS for free to users. This is overwhelmingly helpful for startups, research community and students in deep learning
